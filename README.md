This is a small Android app built with Kotlin and Jetpack Compose. It includes a set of simple countdown timers such as a Pomodoro timer, short breaks, long breaks, and a custom timer where you can enter your own duration.

The goal of the project was to practise Compose UI, navigation, and state management using a ViewModel. It’s a lightweight app, but it covers essential concepts like:

- Navigation with a NavHost  
- Managing timer state with a ViewModel  
- Updating UI with Compose state  
- Using coroutines for ticking the timer  
- Creating multiple screens and a basic UI  

## Features

- **Pomodoro Timer** (25 minutes)  
- **Short Break** (5 minutes)  
- **Long Break** (15 minutes)  
- **Automatic switching** between Pomodoro ↔ Short Break  
- **Custom Timer** where you enter your own minutes  
- Start / Pause / Reset controls  
- Simple, clean visuals
